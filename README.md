# Employees-Analysis
This Python code connects to a SQL Server database using SQLAlchemy and retrieves data from a table named 'Tab_Agent.' The script then performs various data manipulations and analyses using Pandas functions, including displaying summary statistics, filtering data based on a condition, 
selecting specific columns, grouping data, sorting values, and creating a histogram plot.
 The code provides a comprehensive example of using Python, SQLAlchemy, 
and Pandas for SQL database interaction and data analysis.

This Python code connects to a SQL Server database, retrieves data from a specific table ('Tab_Agent'), and performs various analyses using the Pandas library. Here's a breakdown:

    Import Libraries:
        sqlalchemy for database interaction.
        pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

    Define Database Connection:
        Server, database, username, and password are specified.
        An SQLAlchemy engine is created using the provided connection details.

    SQL Query:
        A SQL query is defined to select all columns from the 'Tab_Agent' table.

    Read Data into a DataFrame:
        The SQL query is executed, and the result is read into a Pandas DataFrame named 'df' using the SQLAlchemy engine.

    Data Analysis:
        Various Pandas functions are applied to analyze the data:
            print(df.head()): Display the first few rows of the DataFrame.
            print(df.tail()): Display the last few rows of the DataFrame.
            print(df.describe()): Display summary statistics of the DataFrame.
            print(df.info()): Display information about the DataFrame.
            print(df[df['Nbr_Enfant'] > 2]): Display rows where the 'Nbr_Enfant' column is greater than 2.
            selected_columns: Select specific columns from the DataFrame.
            group_by_gender: Group the data by 'Genre' and calculate the mean of 'Nbr_Enfant' for each group.
            sort_by_values: Sort the DataFrame by the 'Code_Dossier' column in descending order.
            group_by_column: Group the data by 'Code_Dossier' and count the occurrences.

    Data Visualization:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Import the Matplotlib library for plotting.
        group_by_column.plot(kind='hist'): Plot a histogram of the grouped data.
        Additional plot customization with labels and title.
        plt.show(): Display the plot.

It seems like the code is a mix of data retrieval, manipulation, and visualization for analysis purposes.
